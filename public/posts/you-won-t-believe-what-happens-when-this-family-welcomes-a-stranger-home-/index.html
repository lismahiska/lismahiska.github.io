The family is intrigued by the stranger and decides to welcome him into their home.\nEvents Leading Up to the Stranger’s Arrival The family begins their search for a new housemate.

The family begins to spend more time together, talking and laughing. They also learn more about each other and become closer than ever before.\nBut the stranger’s presence also brings unexpected revelations from his past. He opens up to the family and shares stories of his life before he came to their home.
