We recently decided to give it a try and the results were incredible! In this blog post, we’ll take you through the experiment we conducted and share our reflections on the experience\nBackground Information Paper airplanes have been around for centuries, with the earliest known example being a Chinese kite-like glider made of paper in the 5th century BC Over the years, paper airplanes have been used for recreation, science experiments, and even military missions\nPurpose of Experiment The purpose of our experiment was to see if we could make an eagle paper airplane that would fly well. We wanted to see if we could make an eagle paper airplane that would be able to soar through the air with ease.\nExperiment Materials Needed We used a standard sheet of 8.5x11 inch paper, scissors, and tape to make our eagle paper airplane.\nSteps Taken First, we folded the paper in half lengthwise and then cut out a triangle shape from the top of the paper. We then folded the paper in half again and cut out a second triangle shape from the top of the paper. Next, we folded the paper in half again and cut out a third triangle shape from the top of the paper. Finally, we taped the three triangles together to form the wings of the eagle paper airplane.\nResults We were amazed by the results! The eagle paper airplane flew through the air with ease, soaring higher and farther than we ever expected. We were thrilled with the results of our experiment!\nConclusion Reflection on Experience We were very pleased with the results of our experiment. We had a lot of fun making the eagle paper airplane and were amazed by how well it flew. It was a great experience and we learned a lot along the way.\nImplications for Future Experiments This experiment has implications for future experiments involving paper airplanes. We now know that it is possible to make an eagle paper airplane that will fly well. This could be used as a starting point for other paper airplane experiments, such as trying to make a paper airplane that will fly even farther or faster.\nIt’s safe to say that we were all surprised with the results of our experiment to make an eagle paper airplane. After many attempts, we were able to successfully create a paper airplane that resembled an eagle. We were amazed at how well it flew, and how long it stayed in the air. It was a great learning experience and we had fun trying to make the perfect eagle paper airplane. We hope that our experience will inspire others to try their hand at making paper airplanes, and to discover the joy of flight.\nFrequently Asked Questions (FAQ) : Q1: What inspired you to make an eagle paper airplane?\nA1: We were inspired by a challenge from our friends to make the most realistic paper airplane they had ever seen. We decided to take it one step further and make an eagle paper airplane!\nQ2: What materials did you use to make the eagle paper airplane?\nA2: We used a single sheet of standard printer paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler to make the eagle paper airplane.\nQ3: How long did it take you to make the eagle paper airplane?\nA3: It took us approximately one hour to make the eagle paper airplane.\nQ4: How did you make sure the wings of the eagle paper airplane were symmetrical?\nA4: We used the ruler to measure and mark the paper with the same dimensions on each side before cutting it. This ensured that the wings were symmetrical.\nQ5: What were the results of your eagle paper airplane experiment?\nA5: The eagle paper airplane flew surprisingly well! It flew straight and true and stayed in the air for a good amount of time. We were very pleased with the results.\n","wordCount":"663","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-06-24T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-06-24T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Roger Thacker"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://lismahiska.github.io/posts/you-won-t-believe-what-happened-when-we-tried-making-an-eagle-paper-airplane-/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"Lismahiska","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://lismahiska.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://lismahiska.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://lismahiska.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://lismahiska.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://lismahiska.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://lismahiska.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://lismahiska.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>You Won't Believe What Happened When We Tried Making an Eagle Paper Airplane!</h1><div class=post-meta><span title='2022-06-24 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>June 24, 2022</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;4 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;663 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Roger Thacker</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#introduction>Introduction</a></li><li><a href=#background-information>Background Information</a></li><li><a href=#purpose-of-experiment>Purpose of Experiment</a></li><li><a href=#experiment>Experiment</a><ul><li><a href=#materials-needed>Materials Needed</a></li><li><a href=#steps-taken>Steps Taken</a></li><li><a href=#results>Results</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#conclusion>Conclusion</a><ul><li><a href=#reflection-on-experience>Reflection on Experience</a></li><li><a href=#implications-for-future-experiments>Implications for Future Experiments</a></li></ul></li><li><a href=#frequently-asked-questions-faq->Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><h2 id=introduction>Introduction<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#introduction>#</a></h2><p>Have you ever wanted to make an eagle paper airplane?
