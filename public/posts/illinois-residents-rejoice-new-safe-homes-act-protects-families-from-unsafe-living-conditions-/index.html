Poor ventilation, mold, and other hazardous materials can lead to respiratory illnesses and other health issues.

The state is taking action against landlords who fail to comply with the law, and is providing tenants with the resources they need to take legal action if necessary.\nConclusion The Safe Homes Act is a major step forward in ensuring that families in Illinois have access to safe and healthy living conditions. It provides greater protection for tenants, and gives them the power to take legal action if their landlord fails to comply with the law. In addition, the state is providing resources to families in need, and is enforcing the law to ensure that landlords are providing safe and secure homes.\nIllinois residents have reason to rejoice!
