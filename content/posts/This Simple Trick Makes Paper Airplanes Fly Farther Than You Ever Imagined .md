To make your paper airplane fly farther, you will need the following materials: 

- A piece of paper 
- Scissors 
- Tape 

### Detailed Instructions 

1. Start by folding your piece of paper in half lengthwise. 
2. Cut two strips of tape and place them on the back of the paper, close to the fold. 
3. Fold the paper in half again and cut off the excess tape. 
4. Fold the wings of the paper airplane in the desired shape. 
5. Place the two strips of tape along the edges of the wings. 

### Tips for Success 

- Make sure the tape is placed securely so that it won't come off during flight. 
- Experiment with different shapes and sizes of wings to see which ones fly the farthest. 
- Try launching your paper airplane from different heights to see how it affects the flight.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
## Q1: What is the trick for making paper airplanes fly farther?

A1: The trick for making paper airplanes fly farther is to add a small weight to the nose of the plane. This will help the plane to glide farther and longer than it would without the weight. 

## Q2: What kind of weight can be used to make the plane fly farther?

A2: Any small weight can be used, such as a paperclip or a small coin. 

## Q3: How do I attach the weight to the plane?

A3: The weight should be attached to the nose of the plane with a small piece of tape. 

## Q4: How much weight should I add?

A4: A small amount of weight should be used, such as 1-2 grams. Adding too much weight can cause the plane to be too heavy and not fly as far. 

## Q5: Are there any other tips for making paper airplanes fly farther?

A5: Yes, making sure the plane is balanced is important for it to fly farther. Also, making sure the wings are symmetrical and the folds are tight can help the plane fly farther.
