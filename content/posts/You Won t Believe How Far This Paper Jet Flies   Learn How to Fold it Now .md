## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is a paper jet?**

**A1:** A paper jet is a small, paper airplane-like object that is designed to be thrown and flown through the air. It is typically made from a single sheet of paper folded in a specific way to create wings and a tail. 

**Q2: How far can a paper jet fly?**

**A2:** Depending on the design and the strength of the throw, paper jets can fly surprisingly far. Some paper jets have been known to travel up to 50 feet or more. 

**Q3: What materials do I need to make a paper jet?**

**A3:** The only material you need to make a paper jet is a single sheet of paper. You can use any type of paper you like, but printer paper or construction paper work best. 

**Q4: How do I fold a paper jet?**

**A4:** There are many different designs for paper jets, but the basic process for folding one is the same. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise, then fold the top corners down to meet the center line. After that, fold the wings and tail, and you're done! 

**Q5: Are there any tricks to making a paper jet fly farther?**

**A5:** Yes! The key to making a paper jet fly farther is in the throw. Make sure to put some spin on the paper jet as you throw it and aim for a smooth, level release. Also, try adjusting the wings and tail to get the best flight performance.
