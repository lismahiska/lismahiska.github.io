When selecting the paper for your paper airplane, it's important to choose a lightweight paper that is easy to fold. Cardstock is a great option, as it is light and strong. Additionally, it's helpful to choose a paper that is a solid color, as this will make it easier to see the folds.

## Step 3: Test the Plane

Once you have folded the paper, the next step is to test the plane. To do this, you will need to throw the paper airplane forward with a quick flick of the wrist. This will help you to determine if the plane is balanced and if the wings are the right shape.

### Tips for Getting the Best Results

When testing the plane, it's important to throw it in an open area with plenty of room. Additionally, it's helpful to adjust the wings and tail of the plane if it isn't flying correctly. This will help you to get the best results.
