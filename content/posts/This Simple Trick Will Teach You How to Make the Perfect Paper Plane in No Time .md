## Definition of a Paper Plane

A paper plane is a type of model aircraft that is made out of a single sheet of paper. It is usually folded into a symmetrical shape and then launched into the air. Paper planes are usually flown for recreation and can be used for competitions.

## Overview of the Trick

The trick to making the perfect paper plane is to fold the paper in a specific way. This will create a symmetrical shape that will give the plane the best chance of flying straight and far. It also helps to add a tail to the plane, which will help keep it stable in the air.

## Steps for Making the Perfect Paper Plane

The first step in making the perfect paper plane is to fold the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again, but this time widthwise. This will create a symmetrical shape that will give the plane the best chance of flying straight and far.

### Step 2: Making the Wings

The next step is to make the wings of the plane. To do this, fold the top corners of the paper in towards the center of the plane. This will create two wings that will help the plane stay stable in the air.

### Step 3: Adding the Tail

The last step is to add a tail to the plane. This will help keep the plane stable in the air and will also help it fly farther. To make the tail, fold the bottom corners of the paper in towards the center of the plane.

## Conclusion
