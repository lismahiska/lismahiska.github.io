Making a paper plane that flies forever may seem like an impossible task, but with a few easy steps, you can unlock the secret to making a paper plane that can stay in the air for an indefinite amount of time. With a few simple steps, you can make a paper plane that can stay in the air for as long as you want.

To start, you need to create a paper plane that has a good balance of weight and lift. This can be achieved by making sure that the wings are the right size, the nose is the right shape, and the tail is the right length. Once you have the right balance of weight and lift, you can then add a propeller to the plane. This will help to keep the plane in the air for longer periods of time.

Next, you can add a small motor to the plane. This will help to keep the plane in the air for an even longer amount of time. You can also add a timer to the motor to make sure that the plane will stay in the air for as long as you want it to.

Finally, you can add a battery to the plane. This will help to keep the plane in the air for an even longer amount of time. With the battery, you can set the timer to make sure that the plane stays in the air for as long as you want it to.

By following these steps, you can unlock the secret to making a paper plane that can stay in the air for an indefinite amount of time. With a few simple steps, you can make a paper plane that can stay in the air for as long as you want it to. With the right balance of weight and lift, a propeller, a motor, and a battery, you can make a paper plane that can stay in the air for as long as you want it to. So, unlock the secret to making a paper plane that flies forever and have fun with your new paper plane!
