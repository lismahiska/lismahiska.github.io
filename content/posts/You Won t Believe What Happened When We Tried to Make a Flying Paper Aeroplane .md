IV Conclusion

## Introduction

Making a paper aeroplane is a classic activity that has been enjoyed by children and adults alike for generations We decided to take this activity to the next level by attempting to make a flying paper aeroplane In this blog post, we will discuss the process of making the plane and the results of our experiment

## Background of the Experiment

We wanted to make a paper aeroplane that could actually fly. We had seen many designs for paper aeroplanes online, but we wanted to create something unique. After researching different designs and materials, we decided to make a plane out of a large sheet of paper and some tape.

## Purpose of the Experiment

The purpose of the experiment was to make a paper aeroplane that could fly. We wanted to see if we could make a plane that could stay in the air for more than a few seconds. We also wanted to see if our design could be improved upon.

## Process of Making the Paper Aeroplane

### Gathering the Materials

The first step was to gather the materials. We used a large sheet of paper, some tape, and a pair of scissors. We also used a ruler to measure the paper and make sure that the folds were even.

### Assembling the Plane

Once we had all of the materials, we began assembling the plane. We used the ruler to measure the paper and make sure that the folds were even. We then used the tape to secure the folds and make sure that the plane was sturdy.

## Results of the Experiment

### Attempts to Fly the Plane

Once the plane was assembled, we took it outside to give it a test run. We threw the plane into the air and it flew for a few seconds before crashing back to the ground. We then tried a few more times, with similar results.

### Final Outcome of the Experiment

After several attempts, we concluded that our paper aeroplane was not able to stay in the air for a prolonged period of time. We decided to go back to the drawing board and try to improve the design.

## Conclusion

Making a flying paper aeroplane was a fun and interesting experiment. Although we were not able to make a plane that could stay in the air for a long time, we learned a lot in the process. We will continue to work on our design and hopefully one day we will have a paper aeroplane that can really fly!

After a long day of trying, we finally did it! We managed to make a flying paper aeroplane that actually flew! It was an incredible feeling to see our invention take off and soar through the air. We had put in so much effort and time into this project, and it was very satisfying to see it pay off. We were amazed at how far the aeroplane went and how long it stayed in the air. It was truly an incredible feat and a testament to our creativity and hard work. We are now more determined than ever to continue with our experiments and see what else we can create! Intent has been a major factor in our success and we will continue to use it to power our future projects.
