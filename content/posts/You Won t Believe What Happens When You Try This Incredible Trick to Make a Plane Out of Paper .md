## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to make a paper plane that flies farther than any other? Well, we have an incredible trick that you won't believe until you try it yourself! With just a few simple steps, you can make a paper plane that will soar through the air like a pro 

## Background Information

Making a paper plane is easy enough. All you need is a single sheet of paper, some scissors, and a little bit of patience. The traditional paper plane is made by folding the paper in half, then folding the edges in to create wings. Once the wings are in place, you can add a tail to the back of the plane to help it fly more efficiently. 

## Overview of the Incredible Trick

The incredible trick is to add a small weight to the nose of the paper plane. This weight will act as a counterbalance and help the plane stay level in the air. The weight should be small enough that it won't affect the aerodynamics of the plane, but heavy enough to keep the plane from tipping over in the air. 

## Thesis Statement 

This incredible trick is easy to do and can make a huge difference in the flight of your paper plane.

**A1:** The trick is to fold a rectangular piece of paper in half diagonally and then fold the resulting triangle in half again. Then, fold the wings of the plane and make a crease down the middle of the body. Finally, open up the wings and you have a paper plane! 

**Q2: What supplies are needed to make a paper plane?**

**A2:** You will need one sheet of rectangular paper. You can use any type of paper you like, such as printer paper, construction paper, or even origami paper. 

**Q3: How long does it take to make a paper plane?**

**A3:** It should take less than a minute to make a paper plane. Once you get the hang of it, you will be able to make a paper plane in less than 30 seconds. 

**Q4: What is the best way to make a paper plane fly?**

**A4:** The best way to make a paper plane fly is to throw it with a smooth, even motion. You want to use your arm and wrist to throw the plane in a straight line. 

**Q5: What is the farthest distance a paper plane can fly?**

**A5:** The farthest distance a paper plane can fly depends on several factors, such as the type of paper used, the weight of the paper, and the way it is thrown. Generally, paper planes can fly up to 100 feet.
