## Background of Harimau Bali 

Harimau Bali is a species of tiger that was once found in the Indonesian island of Bali. It is believed to have been first seen in the late 1th century, and was considered to be a distinct subspecies of the Sumatran Tiger. It was a smaller species than its mainland cousins, with a lighter coloration and shorter stripes. 

The Harimau Bali was a keystone species in its ecosystem, playing an important role in maintaining the balance of the local environment. It was an apex predator, and its presence kept the prey population in check, helping to maintain the health of the local forests. 

## Causes of its Extinction 

Unfortunately, the Harimau Bali was hunted to extinction by the 1940s. The main cause of its extinction was poaching, as the tigerâ€™s fur was highly sought after by hunters. In addition, the destruction of its habitat due to deforestation and agricultural expansion also played a role in its demise. 

## Miraculous Comeback of Harimau Bali 

In recent years, conservation efforts have been made to bring the Harimau Bali back from the brink of extinction. In 2011, the Indonesian government declared the species to be extinct, but in 2017, conservationists announced that the species had made a miraculous comeback. 

## Reintroduction of Harimau Bali 

The reintroduction of the Harimau Bali was made possible through a combination of conservation efforts, reintroduction programs, and successful breeding programs. Conservationists worked to protect the remaining habitat of the tiger and to reduce the threat of poaching. 

Reintroduction programs were set up to reintroduce the tigers back into the wild. These programs involved carefully selecting tigers from captive breeding programs, and releasing them into protected areas. The tigers were monitored and tracked, and their progress was carefully monitored. 

## Success of Reintroduction Program 

The reintroduction program has been a success, and the Harimau Bali is now roaming freely again in the wild. The population is estimated to be around 100 individuals, and is slowly growing. This is a major success for conservationists, and a testament to the power of conservation efforts. 

## Impact of Harimau Bali Reintroduction 

The reintroduction of the Harimau Bali has had a major impact on the local environment. The tiger is a keystone species in the ecosystem, and its presence helps to keep the balance of the local environment. It is also a major tourist attraction, bringing in much-needed revenue to the local economy. 

The reintroduction of the Harimau Bali has also had a cultural impact. The species has become a symbol of hope and resilience for the people of Bali, and its comeback has inspired many to take action to protect the environment.
