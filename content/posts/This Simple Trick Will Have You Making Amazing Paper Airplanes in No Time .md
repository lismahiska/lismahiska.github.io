Making paper airplanes is a great way to pass the time and get creative. It’s also a great way to learn a bit of physics! Paper airplanes can help teach kids about aerodynamics and how different shapes affect the flight of an object. 

## Step-by-Step Guide
Making a paper airplane is easy, but it’s important to follow the instructions carefully. Here’s what you’ll need: 

* Paper 
* Scissors 
* Ruler 

### Instructions
1. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. 
2. Unfold the paper and fold the top corners down to the center line. 
3. Fold the paper in half again. 
4. Fold the bottom corners up to the center line. 
5. Fold the wings down. 
6. Unfold the paper and fold the wings up. 
7. Fold the paper in half again. 
8. Unfold the paper and fold the wings down. 

### Tips for Success
* Make sure the folds are crisp and sharp. 
* Use a ruler to ensure the folds are straight.
