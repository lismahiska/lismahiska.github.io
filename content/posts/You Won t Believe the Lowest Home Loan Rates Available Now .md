### A Definition of Home Loan Rates

Home loan rates, also known as mortgage rates, are the interest rates that lenders charge for home loans. These rates are determined by a variety of factors, such as the loan type, the borrower's credit score, and the current market rate. Home loan rates can be fixed or adjustable, and they can also be interest-only.
