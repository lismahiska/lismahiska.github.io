## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to fly a paper airplane, but weren't sure how? Well, worry no more! In this blog post, we'll show you how to quickly and easily fold a fast paper airplane

## What is a Paper Airplane?

A paper airplane is a lightweight, aerodynamic aircraft made from a single sheet of paper. It is powered by throwing it into the air, and it can stay airborne for a surprisingly long time.

## Benefits of Learning How to Fold a Fast Paper Airplane

Learning how to fold a fast paper airplane can be a fun and rewarding experience. Not only is it a great way to pass the time, but it can also help you understand the principles of aerodynamics. You can also use your newfound skills to compete with friends or family members to see who can make the best paper airplane.

## Steps to Fold a Fast Paper Airplane

Now that you know the benefits of folding a fast paper airplane, let's get started!

### Gather Supplies

You'll need a single sheet of 8.5" x 11" paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler.

### Fold the Wings

Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, use the ruler to measure and mark two points 1.5" from the folded edge. Unfold the paper and fold the two marked points to the center crease.

### Fold the Tail

Now, fold the paper in half widthwise. Then, use the ruler to measure and mark two points 1.5" from the folded edge. Unfold the paper and fold the two marked points to the center crease.
