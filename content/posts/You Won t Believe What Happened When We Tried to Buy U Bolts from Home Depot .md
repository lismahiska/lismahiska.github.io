When we set out to buy U-bolts from Home Depot, we had no idea what we were getting ourselves into. We expected a simple and straightforward shopping experience, but what we got was anything but. After hours of searching, we were unable to find any U-bolts in the store. We then tried to purchase them online, only to find out that Home Depot doesn't even sell U-bolts! We were completely taken aback by this discovery, as it seemed like an odd omission from a store that specializes in hardware. After much research, we discovered that U-bolts are primarily sold through specialty suppliers and are not widely available at big box stores like Home Depot.
