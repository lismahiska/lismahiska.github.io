IV Conclusion

## Introduction 
Have you ever wanted to make a fighter plane out of paper? It may sound impossible, but it is actually quite easy to do! With just a few simple materials, you can make an amazing paper fighter plane that can actually fly 

## Background Information
Paper airplanes have been around for centuries, and they have been used for both entertainment and scientific experiments. The Wright brothers famously used paper airplanes to test their theories of flight. Today, paper airplanes are a fun way to explore the principles of aerodynamics.

## Overview of the Process
Making a paper fighter plane is a simple three-step process: gathering the materials, cutting and assembling the paper, and testing the plane’s flight. With a little bit of patience and practice, you can make a fighter plane out of paper that can actually fly!

## Making the Fighter Plane
The first step in making a paper fighter plane is to gather the materials. You will need paper, scissors, tape, and a ruler. Once you have all of the materials, you can begin cutting and assembling the paper. It is important to make sure that all of the pieces are cut accurately and that the plane is assembled properly.

## Testing the Fighter Plane
Once the plane is assembled, it is time to test its flight. You can test the plane by throwing it in the air or by using a fan to blow air underneath it. If the plane does not fly as well as you would like, you can make adjustments to the wings or the tail to improve its flight.

## Conclusion
Making a fighter plane out of paper is a fun and easy way to explore the principles of aerodynamics. With a few simple materials and a bit of patience, you can make a paper fighter plane that can actually fly!

So if you’re looking for a fun and creative project to try, why not give making a paper fighter plane a shot? You won’t regret it!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the most important material to use when making a paper fighter plane?**

**A1:** The most important material to use when making a paper fighter plane is a sturdy paper, such as cardstock. This will help to ensure that the plane is strong enough to fly.

**Q2: How long will a paper fighter plane typically last?**

**A2:** A paper fighter plane should last for several flights, depending on how well it is constructed and how well it is flown. However, it is important to keep in mind that the paper will eventually wear out and need to be replaced.

**Q3: What type of paper is best for making a paper fighter plane?**

**A3:** The best type of paper for making a paper fighter plane is cardstock. Cardstock is thicker and stronger than regular paper, and will help to ensure that the plane is durable and can withstand the pressures of flight.

**Q4: What type of tools are needed to make a paper fighter plane?**

**A4:** The tools needed to make a paper fighter plane include scissors, a ruler, and a glue stick. These tools will help to ensure that the plane is properly constructed and that the parts are securely attached.

**Q5: What is the best way to test a paper fighter plane?**

**A5:** The best way to test a paper fighter plane is to launch it in an open area, such as a park or an open field. This will allow you to observe the plane’s performance and make any necessary adjustments before attempting to fly it in a more confined space.
