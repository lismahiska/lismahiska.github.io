# This Simple Trick Will Help You Make a Record-Breaking Paper Plane

Are you looking for a way to make a paper plane that will soar? Look no further! This simple trick will help you make a record-breaking paper plane that you won't believe how easy it is to make

## Introduction

Making a paper plane is a fun and easy way to pass the time. Paper planes have been around for centuries, but the modern paper plane is believed to have been invented in 10 by British inventor Sir George Cayley.

Paper planes are usually made with a piece of paper folded into a triangle shape and then thrown. While this is a classic way to make a paper plane, it won't get you very far. If you want to make a paper plane that will soar, you'll need to try this simple trick.

## Overview of Topic

This simple trick involves folding the paper in a specific way so that it will create a plane with a longer flight path. It's a simple yet effective way to make a paper plane that will travel farther than ever before.

## Step 1: Assemble the Materials

The first step to making a record-breaking paper plane is to gather the materials you'll need. You'll need a piece of paper, a ruler, and a pair of scissors.

## Step 2: Create the Folds

Once you have your materials, it's time to start folding. To make the plane, you'll need to fold the paper in a specific way. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then fold the top corners in so that they meet in the middle. Finally, fold the bottom corners in so that they meet in the middle.

## Step 3: Test the Plane

After you've finished folding the paper, it's time to test the plane. Hold the plane in the air and give it a gentle toss. If it flies well, you've successfully made a record-breaking paper plane!

## Conclusion

Making a record-breaking paper plane is a simple yet effective way to have fun and pass the time. With this simple trick, you can make a paper plane that will soar farther than ever before. So grab a piece of paper and get folding!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick to make a record-breaking paper plane?**

**A1:** The simple trick to make a record-breaking paper plane is to fold the wings of the plane in a certain way to create a design that maximizes lift and stability.

**Q2: How do you fold the wings to maximize lift and stability?**

**A2:** To maximize lift and stability, you should fold the wings of the paper plane in a V-shape with the point of the V facing forward. This will create a design that allows the plane to fly further and more consistently.

**Q3: What is the best type of paper to use for a record-breaking paper plane?**

**A3:** The best type of paper to use for a record-breaking paper plane is a thin, lightweight paper such as tissue paper or printer paper. This type of paper will allow the plane to fly farther and more consistently.

**Q4: Does the size of the paper plane matter?**

**A4:** Yes, the size of the paper plane does matter. A larger paper plane will fly further than a smaller one. However, it is important to make sure that the plane is not too large, as this can cause it to be too heavy and difficult to control.

**Q5: Does the environment affect how far the paper plane will fly?**

**A5:** Yes, the environment can affect how far the paper plane will fly. Windy conditions can help the plane fly further, while humid conditions can make the plane more difficult to control.
