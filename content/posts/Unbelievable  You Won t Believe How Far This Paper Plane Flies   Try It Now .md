## Introduction
Are you looking for a fun and easy experiment to do with your family or friends? Then you won’t want to miss this one! We’re going to explore the science behind paper planes and see how far they can fly We’ll even provide step-by-step instructions so you can try it out yourself 

### Definition of Paper Plane
A paper plane, also known as a paper airplane, is a type of glider made out of paper or cardstock It is usually propelled by throwing it in the air The motion of the paper plane is affected by its shape and weight, as well as the air currents 

### Benefits of Paper Plane
Paper planes are a great way to learn about the principles of aerodynamics and physics. They’re also a fun way to spend time with family and friends. Plus, they’re easy to make and don’t cost much money. 

### Overview of the Experiment
In this experiment, we’ll be testing how far a paper plane can fly. We’ll provide step-by-step instructions so you can make your own paper plane and test it out. We’ll also provide some variations on the experiment so you can try out different shapes and weights. 

## Experiment 
### Materials Needed
To do this experiment, you’ll need the following materials: 
- Paper or cardstock 
- Scissors 
- Tape 
- Ruler 

### Step-by-Step Instructions
1. Cut out a piece of paper or cardstock into a rectangular shape. 
2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise. 
3. Unfold the paper and fold the two corners in to meet in the middle. 
4. Fold the paper in half again lengthwise. 
5. Unfold the paper and fold the two corners in to meet in the middle again. 
6. Fold the paper in half one more time lengthwise. 
7. Unfold the paper and fold the two corners in to meet in the middle one last time. 
8. Tape the two corners together to form a triangle. 
9. Measure the length of the triangle and mark it on the paper. 
10. Cut the triangle along the marked line. 
11. Tape the two sides of the triangle together to form a paper plane. 
12. Throw the paper plane and measure how far it flies. 

### Variations to the Experiment
To see how different shapes and weights affect the flight of the paper plane, you can try out the following variations: 
- Cut out different shapes of paper or cardstock. 
- Add weights to the paper plane. 
- Change the angle of the wings. 

## Conclusion 
### Summary of the Experiment
In this experiment, we explored the science behind paper planes and tested how far they can fly. We provided step-by-step instructions so you can make your own paper plane and try it out. We also provided some variations on the experiment so you can explore different shapes and weights. 

### Explanation of the Results
The results of this experiment depend on the shape and weight of the paper plane, as well as the air currents. Different shapes and weights will affect the flight of the paper plane. 

### Encouragement to Try the Experiment
We hope you enjoyed this experiment and learned something about the science behind paper planes. We encourage you to try out the experiment yourself and explore different shapes and weights to see how far your paper plane can fly.
