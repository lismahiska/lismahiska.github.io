# This Simple Trick Will Make Your Paper Airplane Loop Like a Pro!

Paper airplanes are a fun and easy way to bring out your inner engineer With just a few folds and a little bit of air, you can create a soaring masterpiece But what if you want to take your paper airplane game to the next level? With this simple trick, you can make your paper airplane loop like a pro!

## Introduction

A paper airplane is a simple aircraft made from a sheet of paper. It is propelled forward by thrust generated when it is thrown into the air. Paper airplanes can be used for entertainment, scientific experimentation, and even as a form of transportation.

## Overview of the Simple Trick

This simple trick will teach you how to make a looping paper airplane. With a few easy steps, you can make your paper airplane soar in circles!

## Step-by-Step Guide to Making a Looping Paper Airplane

### Gather the Materials

You will need a sheet of paper, scissors, and tape.

### Fold the Paper into a Triangle

Fold the paper in half lengthwise, then fold the top corners down to meet the middle crease. This will create a triangle shape.

### Create the Loop

Cut a small slit in the top of the triangle. Pull the top corners of the triangle through the slit to create a loop. Secure the loop with tape.

### Test the Looping Paper Airplane

Throw your paper airplane with a gentle flick of the wrist. If you did it correctly, your paper airplane should loop in the air!

## Conclusion

Looping paper airplanes are a great way to show off your paper airplane engineering skills. Not only are they fun to make, but they are also fun to watch as they soar in circles. With this simple trick, you can make your paper airplane loop like a pro!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to make a paper airplane loop?**

**A1:** The trick is to fold the wings of the paper airplane in an asymmetrical way. This will make the plane loop when thrown.

**Q2: How do I fold the wings of the paper airplane in an asymmetrical way?**

**A2:** To fold the wings of the paper airplane in an asymmetrical way, first fold the wings so that one is slightly longer than the other. Then, fold the longer wing in half and tuck it behind the shorter wing.

**Q3: What type of paper should I use for the paper airplane?**

**A3:** The best type of paper to use for a paper airplane is a lightweight type of paper such as printer paper or tissue paper.

**Q4: What type of throw should I use to make the paper airplane loop?**

**A4:** To make the paper airplane loop, you should use a flat, horizontal throw.

**Q5: How do I make the paper airplane fly farther?**

**A5:** To make the paper airplane fly farther, you should make sure that the wings are evenly balanced and that the plane is thrown with enough force. Additionally, you can add weights to the nose of the plane to make it fly farther.
