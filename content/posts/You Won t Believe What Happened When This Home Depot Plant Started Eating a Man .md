It's hard to believe, but it's true - a Home Depot plant actually ate a man! The incident occurred at a Home Depot in California, where a man was shopping for a plant. Little did he know, the plant he was looking at was actually a carnivorous species! When he reached out to touch it, the plant quickly wrapped its leaves around him and started devouring him.

Fortunately, other customers in the store noticed what was happening and quickly called for help. The man was eventually rescued and taken to the hospital, where he was treated for minor injuries.

This bizarre incident highlights the importance of researching plants before you buy them. While it's unlikely that you will ever encounter a carnivorous plant in a store, it's still important to be aware of the potential dangers of buying plants without knowing what species they are.
