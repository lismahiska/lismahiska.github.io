## Introduction

Do you remember the thrill of making paper airplanes as a child and watching them soar through the air? Well, now you can make a paper plane that will come back to you every time! With this simple trick, you can make a plane that will fly further and stay in the air longer than ever before 

## Background Information

Paper airplanes are a fun and easy way to explore the principles of aerodynamics. By making and flying paper planes, you can learn how the shape of the plane and the way it is folded affects the way it flies. You can also learn how air pressure, wind, and other environmental conditions can affect the flight of a paper plane. 

## Purpose of the Trick

The purpose of this trick is to make a paper plane that will fly further and stay in the air longer than a regular paper plane. This will allow you to have more fun with your paper planes and have more control over their flight. The trick also allows you to make a paper plane that will come back to you every time you throw it. 

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Preparing the Paper Plane

The first step is to prepare your paper plane. You will need a sheet of paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half widthwise. Finally, fold the paper in half again widthwise.

### Modifying the Plane for Maximum Distance

The next step is to modify the plane for maximum distance. Start by cutting off the top corner of the paper plane. This will create a longer, more aerodynamic shape that will allow the plane to fly further. 

### Adding the Trick Feature

The final step is to add the trick feature. Take a piece of string and tie it around the middle of the paper plane. This will act as a tether and will cause the plane to fly back to you when you throw it. 

## Conclusion

### Summary of the Trick

In conclusion, this simple trick will make your paper plane come back to you every time. The trick involves preparing the paper plane, modifying it for maximum distance, and adding a tether feature with a piece of string. 

### Benefits of the Trick

The benefits of this trick are that it will allow you to have more control over your paper planes and have more fun with them. The plane will fly further and stay in the air longer, and it will always come back to you. So, give this trick a try and watch your paper planes soar!

We all know the thrill of launching a paper plane and watching it soar through the air. But what if you could make it come back to you every time? With this simple trick, you can! All you need is a piece of paper and a little bit of patience. Simply fold the paper into a traditional paper plane shape, but add a small loop at the end of the plane. This loop will act as a rudder and allow you to steer the plane back to you. Now, when you launch the plane, you can tilt it in the direction you want it to go. It may take some practice, but soon you'll be able to make your paper plane come back to you each and every time. 

This simple trick is sure to add an extra element of fun to your paper plane flying. Whether you're looking for a fun activity to do with your kids or just want to practice your aeronautical engineering skills, this trick will make sure your paper plane always returns to you. So grab a piece of paper and give it a try!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick to make your paper plane come back to you?**

**A1:** The simple trick is to attach a paper clip to the tail of the paper plane.

**Q2: What is the purpose of attaching a paper clip to the tail of the paper plane?**

**A2:** The purpose of attaching a paper clip to the tail of the paper plane is to give it extra weight, which will help it fly in a straight line and come back to you.

**Q3: What type of paper should be used to make the paper plane?**

**A3:** The best type of paper to use for making a paper plane is lightweight paper such as printer paper or copy paper.

**Q4: How does the paper clip help the paper plane fly?**

**A4:** The paper clip helps the paper plane fly by providing extra weight to the tail of the plane, which helps it fly in a straight line and come back to you.

**Q5: How do you attach the paper clip to the paper plane?**

**A5:** To attach the paper clip to the paper plane, simply fold the paper plane in half and slide the paper clip onto the tail of the plane.
