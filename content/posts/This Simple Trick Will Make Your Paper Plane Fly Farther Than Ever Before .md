## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to making a paper plane fly farther?**

**A1:** The trick is to give your paper plane a "delta wing" shape by folding down the wings at an angle. This will give your plane more lift and make it fly farther than ever before.

**Q2: How do I make a delta wing shape for my paper plane?**

**A2:** To make a delta wing shape, start with a regular paper plane and fold the wings down at an angle of about 45 degrees. This will create the delta wing shape and give your plane more lift.

**Q3: Is there anything else I can do to make my paper plane fly farther?**

**A3:** Yes! You can also add a "nose cone" to your paper plane. This will help to reduce drag and make your plane fly even farther.

**Q4: What materials do I need to make a paper plane with a delta wing shape?**

**A4:** All you need is a piece of paper and a pair of scissors. You can also use a ruler to help you get the angles right.

**Q5: How can I find out more about making paper planes?**

**A5:** There are lots of great resources online that can help you learn more about paper plane design. You can also find lots of great tutorials and videos on YouTube that can show you how to make different types of paper planes.
