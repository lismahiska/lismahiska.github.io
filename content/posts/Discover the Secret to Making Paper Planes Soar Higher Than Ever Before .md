Paper planes are a fun and easy way to explore the basics of aerodynamics! With some simple modifications and a few tips, you can make your paper planes soar higher than ever before. By experimenting with different shapes, sizes, and weights of paper, and by adjusting the angle of the wings and the length of the tail, you can find the perfect combination for maximum lift and distance. Understanding the principles of aerodynamics, such as lift and drag, can also help you make your paper planes soar higher than ever before. With a little bit of trial and error, you can discover the secret to making paper planes that reach amazing heights and distances.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the secret to making paper planes soar higher than ever before?**

**A1:** The secret to making paper planes soar higher than ever before is to ensure that the plane is properly balanced and that the wings are designed correctly. Additionally, using heavier paper and making sure the nose is pointed can help the plane fly farther. 

**Q2: What type of paper should I use to make my paper plane?**

**A2:** Heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper is best for making paper planes. This type of paper is more durable and will help your plane fly farther. 

**Q3: What shape should I make the wings of my paper plane?**

**A3:** The wings of the paper plane should be curved slightly upwards on the ends so that the plane can catch more air and soar higher. 

**Q4: How can I ensure that my paper plane is properly balanced?**

**A4:** You can ensure that your paper plane is properly balanced by folding the wings at the same angle and making sure the center of gravity is in the middle of the plane. 

**Q5: What is the best way to launch my paper plane?**

**A5:** The best way to launch your paper plane is to hold it in your hand and throw it forward with an even, consistent motion. This will help the plane to fly farther and higher.
