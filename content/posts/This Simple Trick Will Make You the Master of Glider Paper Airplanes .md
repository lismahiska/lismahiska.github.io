## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is glider paper airplanes?**

**A1:** Glider paper airplanes are a type of paper airplane that uses aerodynamic forces to stay in the air for a longer period of time compared to regular paper airplanes. They are often made from a single sheet of paper and require no external power source.

**Q2: What is the simple trick to make a glider paper airplane?**

**A2:** The simple trick to make a glider paper airplane is to fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold the wings up towards the center of the paper. This will create an aerodynamic shape that will help the paper airplane fly farther and stay in the air for longer.

**Q3: What materials do I need to make a glider paper airplane?**

**A3:** To make a glider paper airplane, you will need a single sheet of paper, scissors, and tape. You may also want to use a ruler to help you make precise folds. 

**Q4: How do I make the wings of a glider paper airplane?**

**A4:** To make the wings of a glider paper airplane, fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold the wings up towards the center of the paper. Make sure that the wings are even and symmetrical.

**Q5: What is the best way to launch a glider paper airplane?**

**A5:** The best way to launch a glider paper airplane is to hold the plane at an angle and gently toss it forward. Make sure to throw the plane with a steady, even motion for the best results.
