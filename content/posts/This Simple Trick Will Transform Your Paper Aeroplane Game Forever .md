## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick that will transform your paper aeroplane game?**

**A1:** The simple trick is to fold the aeroplane in a way that it creates a curved shape. This will help the aeroplane fly further and faster.

**Q2: How do you fold the paper aeroplane to create the curved shape?**

**A2:** Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then fold the paper in half again, this time widthwise. Then fold the top corners of the paper down so that they meet in the middle. Finally, fold the wings up slightly to create the curved shape.

**Q3: What other modifications can you make to the paper aeroplane to improve its performance?**

**A3:** You can add weights such as paperclips to the nose of the plane to help it fly further and faster. You can also trim the wings to reduce drag and increase performance.

**Q4: What are some tips for making the paper aeroplane fly further?**

**A4:** Make sure the plane is well balanced and has a good curved shape. Also, make sure to give it a good throw with a lot of power.

**Q5: What kind of paper should you use to make the paper aeroplane?**

**A5:** The best kind of paper to use is thin, lightweight paper such as printer paper. Heavier types of paper such as cardstock or construction paper will not fly as well.
