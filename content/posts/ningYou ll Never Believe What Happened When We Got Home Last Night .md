## Introduction

We had been out for the evening, celebrating a friendâ€™s birthday, when we got home last night Little did we know that the night would take a turn for the unexpected

## Details of the Event

When we arrived home, we were greeted by a surprise. Our front door was wide open and there was a strange man standing in our living room! We were all quite shocked and scared, but we kept our cool and asked him what he was doing there. He told us that he had been hired by our landlord to do some repairs and that he had accidentally left the door open. 

We were relieved to hear that he was a repairman, but we were still a bit wary. We asked him to leave and he did, but not before giving us a business card and telling us to call him if we ever needed any repairs done. 

## Conclusion

Although we were a bit shaken up by the experience, it was ultimately a harmless one. We learned a valuable lesson to always be aware of our surroundings and to always lock our doors!
