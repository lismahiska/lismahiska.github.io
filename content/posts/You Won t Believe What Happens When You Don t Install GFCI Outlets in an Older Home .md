## Introduction
When it comes to home safety, installing GFCI outlets is a must GFCI outlets provide a layer of protection from electrical shock and fire, which is especially important in older homes In this blog post, we'll discuss the definition of GFCI outlets, the benefits of installing them in older homes, and the risks of not installing them 

## Definition of GFCI Outlets
GFCI stands for Ground Fault Circuit Interrupter It's an outlet that prevents electric shock by sensing any difference in the amount of current going to and returning from the outlet If it senses a difference, it will trip the circuit, cutting off the power to the outlet

## Benefits of Installing GFCI Outlets
GFCI outlets are a great way to keep your home safe. They can help prevent electrical shocks, fires, and damage to appliances. They also provide an extra layer of protection in case of a power surge.
