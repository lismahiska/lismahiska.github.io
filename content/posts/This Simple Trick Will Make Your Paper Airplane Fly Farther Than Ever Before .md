3. Add the simple trick: Attach the small weight to the nose of the paper airplane.

## Benefits of the Simple Trick

Using this simple trick will give you several benefits:

1. Increased distance: The paper airplane will fly farther than before.

2. More interesting flight: The paper airplane will have a more interesting flight pattern with the added weight.

3. More efficient use of materials: You can use the same sheet of paper multiple times, as the added weight helps to reduce drag.

With this simple trick, you can make your paper airplane fly farther than ever before. So grab a sheet of paper and give it a try!
