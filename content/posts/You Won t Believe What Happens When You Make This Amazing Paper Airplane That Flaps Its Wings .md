# You Won't Believe What Happens When You Make This Amazing Paper Airplane That Flaps Its Wings!

## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to make a paper airplane that actually flaps its wings? Well, you're in luck! This amazing paper airplane is designed to do just that! 

## What is a paper airplane that flaps its wings?

A paper airplane that flaps its wings is a paper airplane that has two wings that are connected by a hinge. When the paper airplane is thrown, the wings will flap up and down, creating lift and allowing the airplane to fly farther and stay in the air longer.

## Benefits of making this paper airplane

Making this paper airplane is a great way to teach kids about aerodynamics and how things fly. It's also a great way to have fun and show off your paper airplane skills! 

## Overview of the steps to make this paper airplane

Making this paper airplane is easy and only requires a few simple steps. We'll go through the steps in detail below.

## Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Gather materials: You'll need a piece of paper, scissors, tape, and some weights (such as paperclips or coins).

2. Cut and fold the paper: Fold the paper in half lengthwise, then fold the two sides into the center.

3. Attach the wings and tail: Cut two wings from the paper and attach them to the center of the paper airplane with tape. Cut a tail and attach it to the back of the airplane.

4. Add weights and balance the airplane: Add weights to the wings and tail to help balance the airplane. You can use paperclips or coins.

## Conclusion

Making this paper airplane is a great way to have fun and learn about aerodynamics. It's also a great way to show off your paper airplane skills! Here are some tips for making the best paper airplane: make sure the wings and tail are balanced, use weights to help balance the airplane, and make sure the paper is thick enough to hold its shape. So, go ahead and give it a try!

So, if you're looking for a fun and exciting way to pass the time, then this amazing paper airplane is definitely worth a try.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
## Q1: How do you make a paper airplane that flaps its wings?

A1: To make a paper airplane that flaps its wings, you will need to construct a simple mechanism using two rubber bands and a paper clip. Attach one rubber band to the paper clip and the other to the paper airplane. Then, when you pull back on the rubber band attached to the paper clip, the rubber band attached to the paper airplane will stretch and cause the wings to flap.

## Q2: What type of paper should be used to make the paper airplane?

A2: The best type of paper to use for a paper airplane that flaps its wings is a thin, lightweight paper such as printer paper or tissue paper. Using a thicker paper will make it difficult for the wings to flap.

## Q3: How long can the paper airplane fly?

A3: The paper airplane can fly for as long as the rubber bands remain stretched. Once the rubber bands lose their tension, the wings will stop flapping and the paper airplane will no longer be able to fly.

## Q4: Are there any other materials needed to make the paper airplane?

A4: In addition to the paper and rubber bands, you will also need a paper clip to construct the mechanism that causes the wings to flap.

## Q5: What is the best way to launch the paper airplane?

A5: The best way to launch the paper airplane is to hold it in the air and pull back on the rubber band attached to the paper clip. This will cause the rubber band attached to the paper airplane to stretch and the wings to flap, propelling the paper airplane forward.
