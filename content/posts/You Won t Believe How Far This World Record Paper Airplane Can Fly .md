# You Won't Believe How Far This World Record Paper Airplane Can Fly!

We've all made paper airplanes as kids, but few of us have achieved the same level of success as John Collins Collins is the creator of the world record-breaking paper airplane, which has been recognized by the Guinness World Records for its impressive flight

## Introduction

John Collins is the creator of the world record-breaking paper airplane. His design is based on the classic paper airplane, but with some modifications to make it more aerodynamic and capable of flying farther. The design has been recognized by the Guinness World Records for its impressive flight.

## Background Information

John Collins' paper airplane is made of a single sheet of paper. The paper is folded in a specific way to create a stable and aerodynamic shape. The paper is then coated with a special wax to make it more resistant to air resistance. The plane is then launched using a special launcher that helps it reach an optimal airspeed.

The flight was conducted in an open field with no wind and a temperature of 70 degrees Fahrenheit. The plane flew for a total of 26.1 seconds and achieved a distance of 226 feet.

## Record-Breaking Flight

The record-breaking flight of John Collins' paper airplane was truly remarkable. The plane flew for a total of 26.1 seconds and achieved a distance of 226 feet. This is an incredible accomplishment, considering the plane was made of a single sheet of paper and was launched using a simple launcher.
