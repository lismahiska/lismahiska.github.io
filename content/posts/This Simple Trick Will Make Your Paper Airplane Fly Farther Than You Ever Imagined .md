Before you can use the simple trick to make your paper airplane fly farther, you must first make a paper airplane. Here are the basic steps to make a paper airplane:

### Gather Materials

First, you will need to gather the materials necessary to make your paper airplane. You will need a piece of paper, scissors, tape, and a ruler. 

### Fold the Paper

Next, you will need to fold the paper. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the paper in half again widthwise. Finally, fold the paper in half one more time lengthwise. 

### Create the Wings

Once the paper is folded, you can create the wings. Start by folding the top corners of the paper towards the center. Then, fold the bottom corners of the paper towards the center. Finally, fold the wings down to create the shape of the paper airplane. 

## Simple Trick to Make Your Paper Airplane Fly Farther

Now that you have made your paper airplane, it's time to use the simple trick to make it fly farther. Here are the steps to make your paper airplane fly farther:

### Adjust the Angle of the Wings

First, you will need to adjust the angle of the wings. To do this, you will need to fold the wings up slightly. This will create more lift and allow the paper airplane to fly farther. 

### Add Weight to the Nose

Next, you will need to add weight to the nose of the paper airplane. This can be done by adding a small piece of tape or a paperclip to the nose of the paper airplane. This will help the paper airplane stay stable and fly farther. 

### Launch with Force

Finally, you will need to launch the paper airplane with force. To do this, hold the paper airplane firmly and throw it with a swift motion. This will help the paper airplane gain more speed and fly farther. 

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this simple trick will make your paper airplane fly farther than you ever imagined. By following the steps outlined in this post, you will be able to make a paper airplane that flies farther and higher than ever before. The benefits of this trick are that it is easy to do and can be done with minimal materials. So, what are you waiting for? Give it a try and see how far your paper airplane can fly!
