## Attempting the World Record: Where to Attempt the Record and How to Measure Success

The best place to attempt the world record for paper planes is an open, outdoor space with no wind. This will give you the best chance of achieving the longest distance possible.

To measure success, you will need to measure the distance the paper plane flew from the point of release. The paper plane must travel at least 200 meters to break the world record.

## Conclusion: What You Learned and Any Tips for Others

Making a paper plane and attempting to break the world record is a fun and educational activity. You will learn about aerodynamics, the importance of preparing for flight, and the satisfaction of achieving a goal.

If you are attempting the world record for paper planes, make sure to measure the distance from the point of release. Also, make sure to fly the plane in an open, outdoor space with no wind. Good luck!
