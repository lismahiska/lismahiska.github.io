## Introduction

Have you ever wanted to make a super paper plane that could fly farther than any other? Well, that's exactly what we tried to do recently! In this blog post, we'll explain the background information, the purpose of our experiment, and the results that we got

## Background Information

Paper planes have been around for centuries, but they've never been able to fly very far. That's why we decided to try and make a super paper plane that could fly farther than any other. We wanted to see if we could make a plane that could fly farther than any other, and we were determined to make it happen.

## Purpose of the Experiment

The purpose of our experiment was to see if we could make a super paper plane that could fly farther than any other. We wanted to see if we could make a plane that could fly farther than any other, and we were determined to make it happen.

## Experiment

For our experiment, we gathered the following materials: 
* 8 sheets of 8.5x11 inch paper 
* A pair of scissors 
* A ruler 
* A pencil 

We then followed these steps to construct the plane: 
1. Fold the paper in half lengthwise 
2. Cut the paper in half 
3. Fold the paper in half widthwise 
4. Fold the paper in thirds lengthwise 
5. Fold the paper in thirds widthwise 
6. Cut the paper in half 
7. Fold the paper in half lengthwise 
8. Cut the paper in half 
9. Fold the paper in half widthwise 
10. Fold the paper in thirds lengthwise 
11. Fold the paper in thirds widthwise 
12. Cut the paper in half 
13. Fold the paper in half lengthwise 
14. Cut the paper in half 
15. Fold the paper in half widthwise 
16. Fold the paper in thirds lengthwise 
17. Fold the paper in thirds widthwise 
18. Cut the paper in half 
19. Fold the paper in half lengthwise 
20. Cut the paper in half 
21. Fold the paper in half widthwise 
22. Fold the paper in thirds lengthwise 
23. Fold the paper in thirds widthwise 
24. Cut the paper in half 
25. Fold the paper in half lengthwise 
26. Cut the paper in half 
27. Fold the paper in half widthwise 
28. Fold the paper in thirds lengthwise 
29. Fold the paper in thirds widthwise 
30. Cut the paper in half 

Once the plane was constructed, we tested it by throwing it as far as we could.

## Results

The plane flew an impressive distance of 25 feet! It took us about 15 minutes to construct the plane, and we made a few modifications along the way to make sure it flew as far as possible.

Overall, we were very pleased with the results of our experiment. We were able to make a super paper plane that flew farther than any other!

Intent is a powerful tool for achieving goals, and that was certainly the case when we tried making this super paper plane. After a few trial and error attempts, we finally figured out the perfect design that allowed the plane to soar! We were amazed at how far it could fly and how long it stayed in the air. Our experiment was a success, and it's proof that with the right intent and determination, anything is possible.
