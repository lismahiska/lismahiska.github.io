## What is a Glider Paper Plane?
A glider paper plane is a paper airplane that is designed to fly long distances and stay in the air for a long time It is designed to be lightweight and aerodynamic, allowing it to fly farther and longer than a regular paper airplane 

## Benefits of Making a Glider Paper Plane
Making a glider paper plane is a great way to have fun and get creative. It’s also a great way to learn about aerodynamics and engineering. Plus, you can have competitions with your friends to see who can make the best glider paper plane.

## Steps for Making a Glider Paper Plane
Making a glider paper plane is easy and only requires a few materials. Here are the steps for making a glider paper plane:

### Gather Materials
You will need a sheet of 8.5x11 inch paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler.

### Cut and Fold the Paper
Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, cut off a small piece from the top of the paper. Unfold the paper and fold it in half again, this time widthwise. Then, cut off a small piece from the top of the paper. Unfold the paper and you should now have a diamond shape.

### Finishing Touches
Fold the diamond in half, making a triangle. Then, fold the top two corners down to the bottom of the triangle. Finally, fold the bottom point up to the top of the triangle. Your glider paper plane is now ready to fly!
