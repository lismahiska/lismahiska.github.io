## Introduction
Have you ever wanted to make an eagle paper airplane? We recently decided to give it a try and the results were incredible! In this blog post, we'll take you through the experiment we conducted and share our reflections on the experience

## Background Information
Paper airplanes have been around for centuries, with the earliest known example being a Chinese kite-like glider made of paper in the 5th century BC Over the years, paper airplanes have been used for recreation, science experiments, and even military missions

## Purpose of Experiment
The purpose of our experiment was to see if we could make an eagle paper airplane that would fly well. We wanted to see if we could make an eagle paper airplane that would be able to soar through the air with ease.

## Experiment

### Materials Needed
We used a standard sheet of 8.5x11 inch paper, scissors, and tape to make our eagle paper airplane.

### Steps Taken
First, we folded the paper in half lengthwise and then cut out a triangle shape from the top of the paper. We then folded the paper in half again and cut out a second triangle shape from the top of the paper. Next, we folded the paper in half again and cut out a third triangle shape from the top of the paper. Finally, we taped the three triangles together to form the wings of the eagle paper airplane.

### Results
We were amazed by the results! The eagle paper airplane flew through the air with ease, soaring higher and farther than we ever expected. We were thrilled with the results of our experiment!

## Conclusion

### Reflection on Experience
We were very pleased with the results of our experiment. We had a lot of fun making the eagle paper airplane and were amazed by how well it flew. It was a great experience and we learned a lot along the way.

### Implications for Future Experiments
This experiment has implications for future experiments involving paper airplanes. We now know that it is possible to make an eagle paper airplane that will fly well. This could be used as a starting point for other paper airplane experiments, such as trying to make a paper airplane that will fly even farther or faster.

It's safe to say that we were all surprised with the results of our experiment to make an eagle paper airplane. After many attempts, we were able to successfully create a paper airplane that resembled an eagle. We were amazed at how well it flew, and how long it stayed in the air. It was a great learning experience and we had fun trying to make the perfect eagle paper airplane. We hope that our experience will inspire others to try their hand at making paper airplanes, and to discover the joy of flight.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What inspired you to make an eagle paper airplane?**

**A1:** We were inspired by a challenge from our friends to make the most realistic paper airplane they had ever seen. We decided to take it one step further and make an eagle paper airplane!

**Q2: What materials did you use to make the eagle paper airplane?**

**A2:** We used a single sheet of standard printer paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler to make the eagle paper airplane. 

**Q3: How long did it take you to make the eagle paper airplane?**

**A3:** It took us approximately one hour to make the eagle paper airplane. 

**Q4: How did you make sure the wings of the eagle paper airplane were symmetrical?**

**A4:** We used the ruler to measure and mark the paper with the same dimensions on each side before cutting it. This ensured that the wings were symmetrical. 

**Q5: What were the results of your eagle paper airplane experiment?**

**A5:** The eagle paper airplane flew surprisingly well! It flew straight and true and stayed in the air for a good amount of time. We were very pleased with the results.
