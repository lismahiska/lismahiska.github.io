## Overview of Paper Airplane Flying

Paper airplanes are a fun way to pass the time and show off your creativity. You can make them in a variety of shapes and sizes, and they can fly for surprisingly long distances. However, if you want your paper airplane to fly straight, you’ll need to make a few adjustments. 

## Benefits of Making a Paper Airplane Fly Straight

Making your paper airplane fly straight has a few key benefits. First, it’s more efficient. A straight path requires less energy, so your paper airplane will fly farther and faster. Second, it’s more accurate. If you’re trying to hit a target, a straight path will give you the best chance of success. Finally, it’s more fun. It’s always more satisfying to see your paper airplane fly in a straight line than to watch it wobble and veer off course. 

## Steps to Make a Paper Airplane Fly Straight

Making your paper airplane fly straight is easier than you might think. Here are the steps you’ll need to take: 

### Gather Materials

You’ll need a piece of paper, a pair of scissors, and a ruler. You can use any type of paper, but thicker paper will give you better results.

### Fold the Plane

Fold the paper in half lengthwise, and then fold it in half again. Make sure the folds are as straight as possible. Next, fold the top corners in towards the center, creating a triangle shape. Finally, fold the bottom edges up to meet the top corners. 

### Test the Plane

Now it’s time to test your paper airplane. Hold it in the air and give it a gentle push. If it veers off course, adjust the wings until it flies straight. 

## Conclusion

Making your paper airplane fly straight is simple and rewarding. All you need to do is gather the necessary materials, fold the plane, and test it until it flies straight. The result is a paper airplane that’s more efficient, accurate, and fun to fly.
