# This Simple Trick Makes Paper Airplanes Fly Farther Than You Ever Thought Possible!

Are you looking for a fun and easy way to get your paper airplanes to fly farther? This simple trick is sure to do the trick! 

## Introduction

A paper airplane is a type of toy aircraft, usually made out of folded paper or cardstock. It is often used as an educational tool to teach children about aerodynamics and the principles of flight. The goal of a paper airplane is to fly as far as possible using the least amount of effort.

## Overview of Simple Trick

This simple trick is a great way to get your paper airplanes to fly farther than ever before! It involves folding the paper in a specific way to create a more aerodynamic shape. This shape allows the paper airplane to fly farther and with less effort.

## Demonstration of Simple Trick

### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. Start with a rectangular piece of paper.
2. Fold the paper in half lengthwise.
3. Fold the paper in half widthwise.
4. Fold the top corners inwards to create a triangle shape.
5. Fold the bottom corners inwards to create a triangle shape.
6. Fold the paper in half lengthwise again.
7. Fold the paper in half widthwise again.
8. Fold the paper in half one more time.

If you've ever wanted to make paper airplanes fly farther, then this simple trick is for you! By making a few small adjustments to the design of your paper airplane, you can make it fly farther than you ever thought possible. This trick involves adding an extra fold to the wings of your paper airplane and adjusting the angle of the nose. With these adjustments, you can make your paper airplane soar farther than ever before. So, if you're looking to make your paper airplanes fly farther, give this simple trick a try! You won't believe how far your paper airplane can go!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is this simple trick?**

**A1:** This simple trick is to fold the wings of the paper airplane in a way that creates a "dihedral" angle. This angle helps to stabilize the flight of the paper airplane and makes it fly farther than before. 

**Q2: How do you create a dihedral angle?**

**A2:** To create a dihedral angle, fold the wings of the paper airplane in a “V” shape. The angle of the “V” should be approximately 45 degrees. 

**Q3: What are the benefits of creating a dihedral angle?**

**A3:** The dihedral angle helps to stabilize the flight of the paper airplane and makes it fly farther than before. It also helps the paper airplane to fly more smoothly and accurately. 

**Q4: Is this trick only applicable to paper airplanes?**

**A4:** No, this trick is applicable to other types of aircraft as well. The dihedral angle helps to stabilize the flight of any aircraft, whether it is a paper airplane or a real airplane. 

**Q5: Does this trick always work?**

**A5:** This trick does not always work, as there are other factors that can affect the flight of the paper airplane. However, it is a great way to get the most out of your paper airplane and make it fly farther than before.
