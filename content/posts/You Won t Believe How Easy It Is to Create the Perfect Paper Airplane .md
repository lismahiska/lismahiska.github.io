## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What type of paper should I use to make a paper airplane?**

**A1:** The best type of paper to use is a regular 8.5 x 11 inch piece of printer paper. You can also use construction paper, but it may be too thick and heavy for a good flight. 

**Q2: How do I fold the paper to make a paper airplane?**

**A2:** Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the top two corners of the paper in to meet the center crease. Next, fold the bottom two corners of the paper in to meet the center crease. Finally, fold the paper in half again and you should have a paper airplane shape. 

**Q3: What kind of shape should I make the wings of my paper airplane?**

**A3:** The best shape for the wings of a paper airplane is a triangle. This will give the plane the most lift and stability in the air. 

**Q4: How do I make my paper airplane fly better?**

**A4:** The best way to make your paper airplane fly better is to adjust the wings. Make sure the wings are even and symmetrical and that the nose of the plane is pointed up slightly. You can also add paperclips to the nose of the plane for extra weight and stability. 

**Q5: What is the best way to launch my paper airplane?**

**A5:** The best way to launch your paper airplane is to hold it firmly in the center and throw it with a gentle underhand motion. Make sure you throw the plane with enough force to get it off the ground, but not too much that it will crash into the ground.
