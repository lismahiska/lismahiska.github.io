A retainer is a custom-made dental appliance that is worn to keep teeth in the desired position after orthodontic treatment. It is typically made of plastic and metal wires that fit snugly around the teeth. Retainers are an important part of maintaining the results of orthodontic treatment and should be worn as directed by your dentist.

3. Adjusting the Retainer: Finally, you can use a pair of tweezers to adjust the retainer so that it fits more comfortably. Make sure to adjust it slowly and carefully, as you don't want to break it.
