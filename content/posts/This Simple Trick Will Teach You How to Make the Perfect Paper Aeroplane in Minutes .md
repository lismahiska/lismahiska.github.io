## Q2: How long does it take to make the perfect paper airplane?

A2: It usually takes about five minutes to make the perfect paper airplane. This includes folding and testing the plane to make sure it flies correctly.

## Q3: What type of paper should I use?

A3: The best type of paper to use for making a paper airplane is a thin, lightweight paper such as tissue paper or copy paper. Heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper can be used, but it may not fly as well.

## Q4: What is the best way to test a paper airplane?

A4: The best way to test a paper airplane is to throw it gently in an open area and observe how it flies. Adjustments can be made to the shape and weight of the plane to improve its performance.

## Q5: What is the best way to make a paper airplane last longer?

A5: The best way to make a paper airplane last longer is to use a heavier paper such as cardstock or construction paper. This type of paper is more durable and will fly better than lighter paper. Additionally, it is important to keep the plane clean and free from dirt and debris.
