## Benefits of Paper Planes

Paper planes are a great way to pass the time, but they can also teach you about aerodynamics and physics. By experimenting with different designs and techniques, you can learn about lift, drag, and thrust. You can also learn about the principles of flight and the forces that affect an aircraft in the air.
