# This Easy Trick Will Make Your Paper Plane Fly Farther Than Ever Before!

Paper planes have been around for centuries and have been a fun way to pass time Whether you're at home, in the office, or on a plane, paper planes can provide hours of entertainment But did you know there's a trick that can make your paper plane fly farther than ever before? Read on to learn how!

## Introduction

A paper plane, also known as a paper aeroplane, is a type of model aircraft. It is usually constructed from a single sheet of paper or other thin material, such as card stock. The plane is usually propelled by throwing it or launching it with a rubber band. 

## Overview of the Trick

This trick is simple and easy to do. All you need is a piece of paper, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. With these items, you can make your paper plane fly farther than ever before.

## The Trick

Here's how to do it:

1. Start by folding your paper in half lengthwise.
2. Cut a slit in the center of the paper, about one inch from the fold.
3. Open the paper up and fold each side in towards the center.
4. Fold the top and bottom of the paper in towards the center.
5. Fold the paper in half again.
6. Cut two slits in the center of the paper, about one inch apart.
7. Open the paper up and fold each side in towards the center.

And that's it! Now your paper plane is ready to fly farther than ever before.

## Benefits of the Trick

Not only does this trick make your paper plane fly farther, but it also makes it more aerodynamic. The slits in the paper create a more streamlined shape, which helps the plane fly farther.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, this easy trick will make your paper plane fly farther than ever before. All you need is a piece of paper, a ruler, and a pair of scissors. With these items, you can make your paper plane fly farther and more aerodynamically. So give it a try and see how far your paper plane can go!

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the easy trick to make a paper plane fly farther?**

**A1:** The trick is to fold the wings of the plane at different angles. This gives the plane more lift and allows it to fly farther.

**Q2: How do I fold the wings of the plane?**

**A2:** To fold the wings of the plane, start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then, fold the wings up at a 45 degree angle. Finally, fold the wings back down at a 30 degree angle.

**Q3: Is there any other way to make the plane fly farther?**

**A3:** Yes, you can also add weight to the nose of the plane. This will help the plane fly farther by making it more aerodynamic.

**Q4: What type of paper should I use?**

**A4:** You should use a lightweight paper such as copy paper or construction paper. Heavier paper will make the plane too heavy and won't fly as far.

**Q5: Will this trick work for any type of paper plane?**

**A5:** Yes, this trick will work for any type of paper plane. However, some planes may require slight modifications to the folding technique.
