## Background on Paper Airplanes 

Paper airplanes have been around since the ancient Chinese first discovered the concept of flight. Since then, paper airplanes have become a popular way to pass the time and have even been used in science and engineering experiments. The basic concept of paper airplanes is simple: fold a piece of paper in a certain way so that it can fly. 

## Overview of the Trick 

The trick to making the coolest paper airplane ever is to use a special folding technique. This technique involves folding the paper in a certain way so that the plane is more aerodynamic and can fly farther and faster. This simple trick will make your paper airplane the envy of your friends and family. 

## Step-by-Step Guide 

### Materials Needed 

To make the coolest paper airplane ever, you will need: 

- A piece of paper 
- Scissors 
- Tape (optional)

### Instructions 

1. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. 
2. Fold the top corners of the paper inwards so they meet in the middle. 
3. Fold the bottom corners of the paper inwards so they meet in the middle. 
4. Fold the top corners of the paper inwards again so they meet in the middle. 
5. Fold the bottom corners of the paper inwards again so they meet in the middle. 
6. Flip the paper over and fold the top corners of the paper inwards again so they meet in the middle. 
7. Fold the bottom corners of the paper inwards again so they meet in the middle. 
8. Fold the top corners of the paper inwards one more time so they meet in the middle. 
9. Fold the bottom corners of the paper inwards one more time so they meet in the middle. 
10. Tape the paper together if desired. 

## Conclusion 

### Review of the Trick

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What kind of paper should I use to make the coolest paper airplane?**

**A1:** You should use a standard 8.5x11 inch paper. Thinner paper works best, as it will make the plane more aerodynamic.

**Q2: How do I fold the paper to make the plane?**

**A2:** Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise. Then fold the paper in half again, this time widthwise. Finally, make a triangle shape by folding the top two corners to the center.

**Q3: How do I make the wings of the plane?**

**A3:** To make the wings, fold the top of the triangle down to the center. Then fold the bottom of the triangle up to the center. This will create two wings.

**Q4: How do I make the tail of the plane?**

**A4:** To make the tail, fold the bottom corners of the paper up to the center. This will create a small triangle at the back of the plane.

**Q5: How do I make the plane fly?**

**A5:** To make the plane fly, hold it at the center and throw it like a dart. Make sure to put some spin on the plane as you throw it for maximum distance and stability.
