## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q: What is a paper airplane?**

**A:** A paper airplane is a lightweight aircraft constructed out of paper or other thin material, designed to fly by being thrown, launched, or dropped. 

**Q: What materials are needed to make a paper airplane?**

**A:** The materials needed to make a paper airplane are paper, scissors, and tape. 

**Q: How do you make a paper airplane?**

**A:** To make a paper airplane, start by folding a piece of paper in half lengthwise and unfolding it. Then, fold the top two corners of the paper down to meet the center crease. Next, fold the top two corners in again to make a triangle shape. Finally, fold the wings down and adjust them as needed to make the plane fly. 

**Q: What is the best design for a paper airplane?**

**A:** The best design for a paper airplane will depend on what you are trying to achieve. For example, if you are looking for a plane that can fly the farthest, the dart design is a good option. If you are looking for a plane that can do loops and tricks, the glider design is a better choice. 

**Q: How do you make a paper airplane fly farther?**

**A:** To make a paper airplane fly farther, you can adjust the wings and tail to make the plane more aerodynamic and stable. You can also adjust the weight distribution of the plane by adding paperclips or other small objects to the nose or tail. Finally, you can experiment with different designs to find the one that flies the farthest.
