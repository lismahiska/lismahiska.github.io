## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the simple trick to make my dart plane fly better?**

**A1:** The simple trick is to adjust the center of gravity of the plane. This can be done by adding weight to the nose or tail of the plane, or by changing the location of the battery or other components.

**Q2: How do I adjust the center of gravity?**

**A2:** To adjust the center of gravity, you can add weight to the nose or tail of the plane, or by changing the location of the battery or other components. This can be done by moving the components around until the plane flies better.

**Q3: What are the benefits of adjusting the center of gravity?**

**A3:** Adjusting the center of gravity can improve the stability of the plane and make it fly better. It can also help the plane achieve its maximum potential in terms of speed and maneuverability.

**Q4: What should I do if my plane is still not flying well after adjusting the center of gravity?**

**A4:** If your plane is still not flying well after adjusting the center of gravity, you may need to make other adjustments such as adjusting the propeller size, the wing shape, or the airfoil. You may also need to adjust the control surfaces to make sure they are properly balanced.

**Q5: Is adjusting the center of gravity the only way to make my plane fly better?**

**A5:** No, adjusting the center of gravity is just one way to make your plane fly better. Other adjustments such as adjusting the propeller size, the wing shape, or the airfoil can also help improve the performance of your plane.
