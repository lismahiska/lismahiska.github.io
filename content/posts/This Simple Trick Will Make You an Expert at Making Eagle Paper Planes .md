## Definition of an Eagle Paper Plane 

An Eagle Paper Plane is a type of paper plane that has wings that are angled outwards and a tail that is angled downwards. This design creates an aerodynamic shape that allows the plane to fly farther and stay in the air for a longer period of time. 

## Benefits of Learning How to Make an Eagle Paper Plane 

Learning how to make an Eagle Paper Plane is a great way to have fun and to practice your origami skills. It is also a great way to spend time with friends and family. Additionally, the Eagle Paper Plane can be used to teach children about aerodynamics and the principles of flight. 

## Steps for Making an Eagle Paper Plane 

Making an Eagle Paper Plane is a simple process that requires only a few materials and a few steps. 

### Gather Materials 

To make an Eagle Paper Plane, you will need a piece of paper, scissors, and tape. 

### Fold the Paper 

Fold the paper in half lengthwise and then fold it in half again. Unfold the paper and you should have four creases that form a cross. 

### Create the Wings 

Fold the paper in half again, but this time make sure that the creases form a diamond shape. Make a small fold at the top of the diamond and then fold the sides of the diamond down to create the wings of the plane. 

### Attach the Wings 

Fold the wings up and then use tape to secure them in place. 

### Make the Tail 

Fold the bottom of the paper up to create the tail of the plane. Secure the tail with tape. 

## Conclusion 

Making an Eagle Paper Plane is a fun and easy process that only requires a few materials and a few steps.

This article outlines a simple trick that will help you become an expert at making eagle paper planes in no time. By following the instructions below, you will be able to make these paper planes with ease and accuracy. First, start by folding the paper in half lengthwise and then folding it in half again. Once you have done this, fold the paper in half one more time and then fold it in half again. Once you have done this, you should have a square shape. Next, fold the paper in half along the diagonal and then fold it in half again. After this, fold the paper in half again along the diagonal and then fold it in half again. Finally, fold the paper in half one more time and then fold it in half again. Now you should have an octagon shape. Once you have done this, you can begin to form the eagle paper plane. Start by folding the top corner down and then folding the bottom corner up. After this, fold the left corner down and then fold the right corner up. Finally, fold the top corner down and then fold the bottom corner up. With this simple trick, you will be able to make eagle paper planes with ease and accuracy. With some practice, you will soon become an expert at making these amazing paper creations.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to making a perfect eagle paper plane?**

**A1:** The trick to making a perfect eagle paper plane is to fold the wings in a specific way. Start by folding the paper in half lengthwise, then fold the top corners of the paper down to the center crease. Then fold the wings downwards to create the wings of the plane. Finally, fold the wings up to create the wings of the eagle.

**Q2: How do I make the tail of the eagle paper plane?**

**A2:** To make the tail of the eagle paper plane, start by folding the bottom corners of the paper up to the center crease. Then fold the tail downwards to create the tail of the plane. Finally, fold the tail up to create the tail of the eagle.

**Q3: What is the best way to throw the eagle paper plane?**

**A3:** The best way to throw the eagle paper plane is to hold the paper plane by the wings, then throw it with a gentle flick of the wrist. Make sure to throw it in a straight line and with enough force to keep it in the air.

**Q4: How can I make the eagle paper plane fly farther?**

**A4:** To make the eagle paper plane fly farther, make sure to adjust the wings to create a more aerodynamic shape. You can also adjust the tail to make the plane more stable in the air.

**Q5: What is the best paper to use for making an eagle paper plane?**
