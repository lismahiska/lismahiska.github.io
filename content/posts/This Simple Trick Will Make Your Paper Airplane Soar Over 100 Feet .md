## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
**Q1: What is the trick to making a paper airplane soar over 100 feet?**

**A1:** The trick to making a paper airplane soar over 100 feet is to fold the wings at different angles. This will create a more aerodynamic shape that will allow the plane to fly farther and faster. 

**Q2: What kind of paper should I use to make the plane?**

**A2:** The best type of paper to use for a paper airplane is a lightweight, smooth paper such as printer paper or construction paper. Heavier papers such as cardstock or cardboard will make the plane too heavy and will not fly as far. 

**Q3: How should I fold the wings to make the plane fly farther?**

**A3:** To make the plane fly farther, fold the wings at different angles. This will create a more aerodynamic shape that will allow the plane to fly farther and faster. 

**Q4: What other materials can I use to make the plane?**

**A4:** In addition to paper, you can also use other materials such as aluminum foil or plastic wrap to make the plane. However, these materials tend to be heavier and may not fly as far as a paper airplane. 

**Q5: How can I make the plane fly in a straight line?**

**A5:** To make the plane fly in a straight line, make sure the wings are folded symmetrically and that the nose of the plane is pointed in the same direction. This will help the plane fly in a straight line.
