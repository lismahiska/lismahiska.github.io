## Overview of Our ACNH House Before the Remodel

Before the remodel, our villager house was a bit of a mess. We had furniture scattered around the house, and it was difficult to navigate. The walls were plain and the floors were outdated. We knew it was time for a change, but we weren't sure where to start.

## The Remodel Process and Results

We decided to start with the walls and floors. We chose a bright and cheerful pattern for the walls and a modern wood flooring for the floors. We also added some furniture, such as a couch and a coffee table. We wanted the house to feel more like a home, so we added some decorations such as paintings and rugs.

The results were amazing! Our villager house was transformed into a cozy and inviting home. We were so happy with the results that we decided to take it a step further and add some outdoor furniture and decorations. We added a hammock, a fire pit, and some plants to make the house even more inviting.

## Final Thoughts

We are so happy with the results of our villager house remodel. It's amazing how much of a difference a few small changes can make. We now have a beautiful and inviting home that we can be proud of. We would highly recommend giving your ACNH house a makeover if you're looking for a change.
