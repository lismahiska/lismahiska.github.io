## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) :
<h2>Q: What is the secret to making a paper plane that flies forever?</h2>

<h3>A: The secret to making a paper plane that flies forever is to make it aerodynamic, lightweight, and properly balanced. To make an aerodynamic paper plane, you should make sure that the wings are curved, the nose is pointed, and the tail is straight and flat. To make a lightweight paper plane, you should use lightweight paper and use as few folds as possible. To make a properly balanced paper plane, you should make sure the wings are even and the nose is centered. </h3>

<h2>Q: What type of paper should I use to make a paper plane?</h2>

<h3>A: You should use lightweight paper, such as printer paper or origami paper, to make a paper plane. Heavyweight paper, such as cardstock, is too heavy and will not fly as far or as well as lightweight paper.</h3>

<h2>Q: How do I make sure my paper plane is properly balanced?</h2>

<h3>A: To make sure your paper plane is properly balanced, you should make sure the wings are even and the nose is centered. If the wings are uneven or the nose is off-center, your paper plane will not fly as well.</h3>

<h2>Q: How do I make my paper plane aerodynamic?</h2>

<h3>A: To make your paper plane aerodynamic, you should make sure that the wings are curved, the nose is pointed, and the tail is straight and flat. This will help your paper plane fly further and faster.</h3>

<h2>Q: What is the best way to launch a paper plane?</h2>

<h3>A: The best way to launch a paper plane is to hold it by the nose and throw it with a smooth, even motion. Make sure to throw it with enough force so that it will fly, but not so much that it will crash into the ground. </h3>
